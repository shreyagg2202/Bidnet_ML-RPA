RTD is seeking a robust vendor-supported, software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS) solution from a vendor who will also provide ongoing system maintenance and upgrades, and user-training on the system. The vendor’s case management system will provide functional support that meets RTD’s business requirements using a product that is scalable, fault-tolerant, and meets RTD’s data security, legal, continuity, and disaster recovery requirements. For clarity, RTD does not want an onsite case management system where RTD is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure and software. In addition, RTD desires a SaaS or PasS solution that utilizes best practices in user interface/user design, and a vendor who will maintain the system while allowing RTD to own the data.\"\n",
